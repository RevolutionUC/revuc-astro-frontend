        RevolutionUC is a student hackathon in which we invite students from across the midwest to partake in a weekend
        of code, community, and self-improvement. You don’t have to attend the University of Cincinnati and you don’t
        have to be a computer science major or engineering student. We’re looking for people who share our passion to do
        awesome things with technology.

        event where students who are passionate about technology can come together to create something amazing.

        Over the course of 24 hours you’ll work together with friends, new or old, to create something you can be proud
        of from scratch. With tech talks and industry partnerships for inspiration, the sky is the limit. We’ve seen
        fantastic websites, mobile apps, bots, and hardware hacks, and we can’t wait to see what you’ll make this year.

        Hackathons are more than just a competition or showcase of technical skill. At RevolutionUC, we strive to create
        an all-inclusive community that acts as an outlet in which we can join our peers and share our passion for all
        the incredible things that can be done through programming. That’s why we follow the <a

        here in Cincinnati.
