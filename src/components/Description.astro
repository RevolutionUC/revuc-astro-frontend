            RevolutionUC is a 24-hour in-person student hackathon at the University of Cincinnati 
            that is organized by ACM@UC. We invite you to join 300+ motivated students for an awesome 
            weekend of code, community, and self-improvement! You don’t have to have to be a 
            computer science major or engineering student to attend. It’s a learning experience for students 
            of all skill levels!
